        ├── Concepts (optional, can be at topic level)
        └── Subtopics (optional, can be nested)
              ├── Concepts
              └── Subtopics (recursive nesting supported)
```

### 2. Example Structure

```json
{
  "subject": "Computer Science",
  "grade": 10,
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "Computer Network",
      "subtopics": [
        {
          "name": "Introduction to Networks",
          "concepts": [
            {
              "name": "What is a Computer Network?",
              "summary": "A computer network is a system of interconnected computers...",
              "steps": [
                "Understand basic networking concepts",
                "Learn about network types"
              ],
              "questions": [
                {
                  "question": "What is a computer network?",
                  "acceptable_answers": [
                    "A system of interconnected computers that can communicate and share resources"
                  ],
                  "hints": [
                    "Think about how computers communicate",
                    "Consider resource sharing"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]

## Examples

### Complete Concept Example

```json
{
  "name": "Newton's First Law of Motion",
  "summary": "Newton's First Law states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This property is called inertia. Understanding this law helps explain everyday phenomena like why passengers lurch forward when a bus stops suddenly.",
  "steps": [
    "State the law in words",
    "Define inertia and give examples",
    "Explain the importance of seat belts in vehicles",
    "Relate the law to real-life situations"
  ],
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "State Newton's First Law of Motion.",
      "acceptable_answers": [
        "An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force."
      ],
      "hints": [
        "Law of inertia."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do passengers move forward when a moving bus stops suddenly?",
      "acceptable_answers": [
        "Due to inertia, their bodies tend to remain in motion even when the bus stops."
      ],
      "hints": [
        "Inertia of motion."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
